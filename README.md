# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction

## Overview
This project guides you through the process of building a real estate price prediction website. Starting from data cleaning and model building using the Bangalore home prices dataset from Kaggle, it progresses to the creation of a Python Flask server to serve HTTP requests and a user-friendly website developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
